# Job-Scheduler

## Intentions
This program was made to provide a fast means of organizing jobs of any kind as per certain methods commonly used in job scheduling such as shortest-job-first of first-in-last-out. With as many of these methods as possible I tried to maintain user control through a priority properties that applies to each job.




As many job systems are carried out through computer commands or by importing .CSV files, this program will export data in various formats to serve as a supplementary tool that could improve workflow efficiency. In both cases where exporting the data is not useful as well as when it is the program will generate an image of a Gant chart for an easily understood presentation of the scheduling.

## Implementation
Most functions in this program will use builtin data-stuctures and simple functions to easy to understand source code at a minimal time efficiency as much as possible.

This program is still in progress.
